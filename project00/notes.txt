Press a key on their keyboard to move their player one square

*********
Come back to earth:

-Make a div
-get an image
-adjust in css
-make an event listening click function
-must move to right
*********

Study:
-how to make a track
-make a single player respond to click/move
-research on animate()?
-function.prototype __proto__ vs object prototype
  'Every object within JavaScript has a “secret” property.'
  'Use prototype on something that you want to be shared among all instance of that particular object'
-what is svg vs div vs canvas
-keycodes
-how to .stop(), .finish()
-how to reset

In an ideal world:
Objects:

Game - Player - Player 1
              - Player 2
    - Track   - Track 1
              - Track

Constructor function for Game

Constructor function for Player

Constructor function for Track

Game prototype

Player protoype
Good luck!
