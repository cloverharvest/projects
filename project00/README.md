**Special Credit
-To HeyStenson, and jdelora whose code I closely examined and studied to learn
and get started with OOP games.
-Major credit goes to eeunesti whose Monster Mashup game I broke into
smaller pieces so that I could understand OOP constructor functions and game
logic more, pseudocoding and rebuilding it back, fashioning it in the way I
liked it, and solving the winner declaration bug until I could get my 
version to work.
