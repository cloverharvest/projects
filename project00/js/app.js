//Add the initializer method to the Game prototype property
//This listens to keypress events and then makes both tokens
//move depending on keycode

//Add the reset method to the Game prototype property
//This moves back both players to the start of the racetrack

//Make a Player Constructor function and create a player
//name property

//Adds the move method to the Player prototype property
//This moves by x milliseconds the token's left margin X pixels
//everytime its assigned keycode is pressed
//and then if the token moves(and its left margin is greater or equal
// than x pixels, then game stops and both token are
//stopped from moving

//A winner is declared and posted on messagebox(?)
//Reset game
