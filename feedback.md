**Your project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:**

* **Technical Requirements**: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements?

I would like to see more event listeners to make your javascript more interactive with your html file.

**does not meet expectations**

* **Creativity**: Did you add a personal spin or creative element to your project? Did you deliver something of value to the end user?

Your game was local and pretty! Great image selection and clever positioning of the car on the bridge and the boat in the bay.

**meets expectations**

* **Code Quality**: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code?

Your OOP usage was fantastic.  I liked your prototypical method definitions; thank you for going the extra distance.  Your code is a bit dense; feel free to break out complex logic into a variable to use elsewhere.

**meets expectations**

* **Problem Solving**: Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

Great research on easily moving an icon from A to B with as little code as possible.  It works well!

**meets expectations**
